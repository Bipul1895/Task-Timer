Static Nested Classes :  Behave very similar to a top-level class (which is embedded inside another
top-level class.

Static nested classes are accessed using the enclosing class name: OuterClass.StaticNestedClass

To create an object for the static nested class : OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject =
                                                  new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();

Note that using 'static' for a class is just a packaging convenience.

SQLiteOpenHelper class has private constructor because we need only one instance of that class
during entire run-time. That is why this class is created using 'Singleton class'. This is because
this class provides connection to database as well. Our app is single user and only one db is
required. Making multiple instances makes no sense.
